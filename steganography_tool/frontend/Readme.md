Explanation and Best Practices
Separation of Concerns: The backend and frontend are separated into different directories. The backend handles data processing and logic, while the frontend is responsible for user interaction.

RESTful API: The backend exposes a RESTful API for embedding and extracting messages, as well as classifying data.

Error Handling: While basic error handling is implemented in the steganography.py file, more robust error handling should be added for production use.

AI Model Integration: A stub for the AI classification function is provided. In a real application, you would load a trained model and preprocess the input data appropriately.

File Handling: The frontend handles file inputs using the FileReader API, enabling users to select images for embedding and extraction.

Documentation: Comments and docstrings are provided to explain the purpose of functions and classes, enhancing code readability.

This is a basic implementation and can be extended further with more sophisticated features like quantum computing integration, advanced AI models, and improved UI/UX.

# Steganography with AI/ML

This project implements steganography techniques to embed and extract messages in images and audio files. It also includes AI capabilities for data analysis.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py embed --file image.png --message "Hidden Message"
python main.py extract --file image.png
python main.py analyze --file data.csv
### Conclusion
This code provides a foundational structure for a steganography tool that can embed and extract messages from images and audio files. Additionally, it includes a basic AI component for data analysis. You can extend this implementation with more advanced AI features and integrate quantum computing capabilities as needed based on the specific requirements and context of the application.
